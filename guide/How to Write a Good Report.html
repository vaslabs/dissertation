<p><b><font color="brown" size="+2">How to Write a Good Report</font></b>
<br><b><font color="brown">Bhaskaran Raman, Apr 2004</font></b>

</p><p>This short document describes how to write a good report.  This is
based on common mistakes I have observed over a period of time.  While
most of the following apply in general, they have been written with
BTech/MTech/PhD students in mind.

</p><p>The comments below apply for course projects, other semester
projects, technical reports, theses (BTech/MTech/PhD).  That is,
technical writing in general.  While a google search on the topic may
churn out many hits, the following is tailored for IIT (Kanpur)
students in particular.

</p><p>I will first mention some general <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a>, then the <a href="#structure">structure</a> of the report.  Towards the end, I will
also describe how to <a href="#refine">refine</a> your writing, and how
to give <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> on others' writing.  Based on
these, I will recommend a possible <a href="#strategy">strategy</a> for
producing <i>high-quality reports</i> which have <i>high potential for
being published</i>.

</p><hr>

<a name="guidelines"></a>
<p><font color="brown" size="+1"><b>General Guidelines</b></font>

</p><p>These are some general things you should know before you start
writing.  I will try to answer the questions of the purpose of report
writing, and the overall approach as well.

</p><p><b>Purpose of a report: writing to be read</b>

</p><p>A key thing to keep in mind right through your report writing
process is that a report is <i>written to be read</i>, by someone
else.  This is the central goal of report-writing.  A report which is
written for the sake of being written has very little value.

</p><p>Before you start writing your report, you need to have in mind the
<i>intended audience</i>.  In the narrowest of possibilities, your
report is meant for reading by yourselves, and by your
advisor/instructor, and perhaps by your evaluation committee.  This
has value, but only short-term.  The next broader possibility is that
your report is readable by your peers or your juniors down the line.
This has greater value since someone else can continue on your work
and improve it, or learn from your work.  In the best case
possibility, your report is of publishable quality.  That is, readable
and useful for the technical community in general.

</p><p><b>Overall approach: top-down</b>

</p><p>Take a top-down approach to writing the report (also applies to
problem solving in general).  This can proceed in roughly three stages
of continual refinement of details.

</p><ol>
  <li>First write the section-level
outline,
  </li><li>Then the subsection-level outline, and
  </li><li>Then a paragraph-level outline.  The paragraph-level outline
      would more-or-less be like a presentation with bulleted points.
      It incorporates the flow of ideas.
</li></ol>

<p>Once you have the paragraph-level flow of ideas, you can easily
convert that into a full report, by writing out the flow of ideas in
full sentences.

</p><p>While doing the paragraph-level outline, think also about (a)
figures, (b) tables, and (c) graphs you will include as part of the
report at various stages.  You will find that many things can be
better explained by using simple figures at appropriate places.

</p><p>Another thing to nail-down while doing the paragraph-level outline
is the terminology you will be using.  For instance, names of various
protocols/algorithms/steps in your solution.  Or names/symbols for
mathematical notation.

</p><p>The overall approach also includes multiple stages of refinement,
and taking feedback from others (peers/advisor/instructor).  I will
talk about these in more detail after talking about the overall report
structure.

</p><hr>

<a name="structure"></a>
<p><font color="brown" size="+1"><b>Structure of a report</b></font>

</p><p>The following should roughly be the structure of a report.  Note
that these are just <i>guidelines</i>, not <i>rules</i>.  You have to
use your intelligence in working out the details of your specific
writing.

</p><ul>
  <li><p><b>Title and abstract:</b> These are the most-read parts of a
      report.  This is how you attract attention to your writing.  The
      title should reflect what you have done and should bring out any
      eye-catching factor of your work, for good impact.

      </p><p>The abstract should be short, generally within about 2
      paragraphs (250 words or so total).  The abstract should contain
      the essence of the report, based on which the reader decides
      whether to go ahead with reading the report or not.  It can
      contain the following in varying amounts of detail as is
      appropriate: main motivation, main design point, essential
      difference from previous work, methodology, and some
      eye-catching results if any.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Introduction:</b> Most reports start with an introduction
      section.  This section should answer the following questions
      (not necessarily in that order, but what is given below is a
      logical order).  After title/abstract introduction and
      conclusions are the two mainly read parts of a report.

      </p><ul>
	<li>What is the setting of the problem?  This is, in other
	    words, the <i>background</i>.  In some cases, this may be
	    implicit, and in some cases, merged with the motivation
	    below.
	</li><li>What exactly is the problem you are trying to solve?  This
	    is the <i>problem statement</i>.
	</li><li>Why is the problem important to solve?  This is the
	    <i>motivation</i>.  In some cases, it may be implicit in
	    the background, or the problem statement itself.
	</li><li>Is the problem still unsolved?  The constitutes the
	    statement of <i>past/related work</i> crisply.
	</li><li>Why is the problem difficult to solve?  This is the
	    statement of <i>challenges</i>.  In some cases, it may be
	    implicit in the problem statement.  In others, you may
	    have to say explicitly as to why the problem is worthy of
	    a BTech/MTech/PhD, or a semester project, as the case may
	    be.
	</li><li>How have you solved the problem?  Here you state the
	    essence of your <i>approach</i>.  This is of course expanded
	    upon later, but it must be stated explicitly here.
	</li><li>What are the conditions under which your solution is
	    applicable?  This is a statement of <i>assumptions</i>.
	</li><li>What are the main results?  You have to present the main
	    <i>summary of the results</i> here.
	</li><li>What is the summary of your contributions?  This in some
	    cases may be implicit in the rest of the introduction.
	    Sometimes it helps to state contributions explicitly.
	</li><li>How is the rest of the report organized?  Here you include
	    a paragraph on the <i>flow of ideas</i> in the rest of the
	    report.  For any report beyond 4-5 pages, this is a must.
      </li></ul>

      <p>The introduction is nothing but a shorter version of the rest of
      the report, and in many cases the rest of the report can also
      have the same flow.  Think of the rest of the report as an
      expansion of some of the points in the introduction.  Which of
      the above bullets are expanded into separate sections (perhaps
      even multiple sections) depends very much on the problem.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Background:</b> This is expanded upon into a separate section
      if there is sufficient background which the general reader must
      understand before knowing the details of your work.  It is usual
      to state that "the reader who knows this background can skip
      this section" while writing this section.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Past/related work:</b> It is common to have this as a
      separate section, explaining why what you have done is something
      novel.  Here, you must try to think of <i>dimensions of
      comparison</i> of your work with other work.  For instance, you
      may compare in terms of functionality, in terms of
      performance, and/or in terms of approach.  Even within these,
      you may have multiple lines of comparison -- functionality-1,
      functionality-2, metric-1, metric-2, etc.

      </p><p>Although not mandatory, it is good presentation style to give
      the above comparison in terms of a <i>table</i>; where the rows
      are the various dimensions of comparison and the columns are
      various pieces of related work, with your own work being the
      first/last column.  See the related work section of my PhD
      thesis for an example of such a table :-).

      </p><p>While in general you try to play up your work with respect to
      others, it is also good to identify points where your solution
      is not so good compared to others.  If you state these
      explicitly, the reader will feel better about them, than if you
      do not state and the reader figures out the flaws in your work
      anyway :-).

      </p><p>Another point is with respect to the <i>placement</i> of
      related work.  One possibility is to place it in the beginning
      of the report (after intro/background).  Another is to place it
      in the end of the report (just before conclusions).  This is a
      matter of judgment, and depends on the following aspect of your
      work.  If there are lots of past work related very closely to
      your work, then it makes sense to state upfront as to what the
      difference in your approach is.  On the other hand, if your work
      is substantially different from past work, then it is better to
      put the related work at the end.  While this conveys a stronger
      message, it has the risk of the reader wondering all through the
      report as to how your work is different from some other specific
      related work.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Technical sections:</b> The main body of the report may be
      divided into multiple sections as the case may be.  You may have
      different sections which delve into different aspects of the
      problem.  The organization of the report here is problem
      specific.  You may also have a separate section for statement of
      design methodology, or experimental methodology, or proving some
      lemmas in a theoretical paper.

      </p><p>The technical section is the most work-specific, and hence is
      the least described here.  However, it makes sense to mention
      the following main points:

      </p><ul>
	<li><i>Outlines/flow:</i> For sections which may be huge, with
	    many subsections, it is appropriate to have a rough
	    outline of the section at the beginning of that section.
	    Make sure that the flow is maintained as the reader goes
	    from one section to another.  There should be no abrupt
	    jumps in ideas.
	</li><li><i>Use of figures:</i> The cliche "a picture is worth a
	    thousand words" is appropriate here.  Spend time thinking
	    about pictures.  Wherever necessary, explain all aspects
	    of a figure (ideally, this should be easy), and do not
	    leave the reader wondering as to what the connection
	    between the figure and the text is.
	</li><li><i>Terminology:</i> Define each term/symbol before you use
	    it, or right after its first use.  Stick to a common
	    terminology throughout the report.
      </li></ul>

  </li><li><p><b>Results:</b> This is part of the set of technical sections,
      and is usually a separate section for experimental/design
      papers.  You have to answer the following questions in this
      section:

      </p><ul>
	<li>What aspects of your system or algorithm are you trying to
	    evaluate?  That is, what are the questions you will seek
	    to answer through the evaluations?
	</li><li>Why are you trying to evaluate the above aspects?
	</li><li>What are the cases of comparison?  If you have proposed an
	    algorithm or a design, what do you compare it with?
	</li><li>What are the performance metrics?  Why?
	</li><li>What are the parameters under study?
	</li><li>What is the experimental setup?  Explain the choice of
	    every parameter value (range) carefully.
	</li><li>What are the results?
	</li><li>Finally, why do the results look the way they do?
      </li></ul>

      <p>The results are usually presented as tables and graphs.  In
      explaining tables and graphs, you have to explain them as
      completely as possible.  Identify trends in the data.  Does the
      data prove what you want to establish?  In what cases are the
      results explainable, and in what cases unexplainable if any?

      </p><p>While describing a table, you have to describe every
      row/column.  And similarly while describing a graph, you have to
      describe the x/y axes.  If necessary, you have to consider the
      use of log-axes.

      </p><p>If you are presenting a lot of results, it may be useful to
      summarize the main take-away points from all the data in a
      separate sub-section at the end (or sometimes even at the
      beginning) of the results section.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Future work:</b> This section in some cases is combined along
      with the "conclusions" section.  Here you state aspects of the
      problem you have not considered and possibilities for further
      extensions.

  </p></li><li><p><b>Conclusions:</b> Readers usually read the title, abstract,
      introduction, and conclusions.  In that sense, this section is
      quite important.  You have to crisply state the main take-away
      points from your work.  How has the reader become smarter, or
      how has the world become a better place because of your work?

</p></li></ul>

<hr>

<a name="refine"></a>
<p><font color="brown" size="+1"><b>Refinement</b></font>

</p><p>No report is perfect, and definitely not on the first version.
Well written reports are those which have gone through multiple rounds
of <i>refinement</i>.  This refinement may be through self-reading and
critical analysis, or more effectively through peer-feedback (or
feedback from advisor/instructor).

</p><p>Here are some things to remember:

</p><ul>
  <li>Start early, don't wait for the completion of your work in its
      entirety before starting to write.
  </li><li>Each round of feedback takes about a week at least.  And hence
      it is good to have a rough version at least a month in advance.
      Given that you may have run/rerun experiments/simulations (for
      design projects) after the first round of feedback -- for a good
      quality report, it is good to have a rough version at least 2
      months in advance.
  </li><li>Feedback should go through the following stages ideally: (a) you
      read it yourself fully once and revise it, (b) have your peers
      review it and give constructive feedback, and then (c) have your
      advisor/instructor read it.
</li></ul>

<hr>

<a name="feedback"></a>
<p><font color="brown" size="+1"><b>Feedback: evaluating someone else's report</b></font>

</p><p>Evaluation of a report you yourself have written can give benefits,
but it usually is limited.  Even in a group project, it is not good
enough to have one person write the report and the other person read
it.  This is because all the group members usually know what the
project is about, and hence cannot critique the paper from outside.

</p><p>It is best to take feedback from your peer (and of course return
favours!).  The feedback procedure is quite simple.  The one reading
has to critically, and methodically see if each of the aspects
mentioned above in the "structure of the report" are covered.  It may
even help to have a check-list, although with experience this becomes
unnecessary.

</p><ul>
  <li>Check if the title/abstract make sense, are
      effective/eye-catching.
  </li><li>Are all the relevant questions answered in the introduction?
  </li><li>Is the overall structure of the rest of the sections meaningful?
  </li><li>Is the difference from related/past work crisp and meaningful?
  </li><li>Are the technical sections understandable?  Are the
      figures/tables explained properly?  Is the terminology clear?
      Are the symbols used defined appropriately?
  </li><li>Are the results explained properly?  Are the conclusions drawn
      from the graphs/tables sound?  Or are there technical
      holes/flaws?  Do the results show how the work presented is
      better/worse that the other cases of comparison?
</li></ul>

<p>When I give feedback on a peer's report or a student's report, I
usually take a print-out and mark-up at various points in the paper.
You may follow a similar procedure, or something suited to you.  Be as
critical as possible, but with the view that your peer has to improve
his/her work, not with the view of putting him/her down.  Your
comments have to be impersonal.  Likewise, while taking feedback from
a peer, take the comments on their technical merit.

</p><hr>

<a name="strategy"></a>
<p><font color="brown" size="+1"><b>Recommended strategy for producing a
high-quality report</b></font>

</p><p>Based on the above, I recommend the following strategy for students
who want to produce a high-quality report, which would then have a
high potential for being turned into a publication:

</p><ul>
  <li>Think through the outline of the report even as you are working
      on the details of the problem.  Such thinking will also lend
      focus to your work and you will end up optimizing the returns on
      the time invested.
  </li><li>Two months before the actual deadline, you have to have at least
      a paragraph-level outline of the report, with all details worked
      out.
  </li><li>After one round of critical analysis by yourselves (or by your
      group), have another student or another group review it, perhaps
      in exchange for you reviewing their work.  Have them check your
      flow of ideas.  While it may be good to get someone working in
      the same area, for much of the feedback, this may not really be
      necessary.
  </li><li>Now you are probably about 6-7 weeks from the deadline.  At this
      point, have your advisor/instructor give feedback on the
      paragraph-level outline.  Getting this early is important since,
      based on this, you may have to reorganize your report, rework
      your theorems, or rerun your experiments/simulations.
  </li><li>Have a pre-final version of the report ready 2 weeks before the
      deadline.  Again, go through one round of self/peer-feedback,
      and then advisor/instructor feedback.
  </li><li>With these 3-4 rounds of revision and critical analysis, the
      quality of your report is bound to improve.  And since many of
      the student theses are of good quality, quality of writing
      dramatically improves chances of publication.
</li></ul>
